* no.olavfosse.malt
This is an effort to port [[https://github.com/themetaschemer/malt][Malt]] to Clojure. Malt is a minimalistic deep
learning toolkit designed to support the book [[https://www.thelittlelearner.com][The Little Learner]].

The goal for no.olavfosse.malt is for it to be pleasant to work
through The Little Learner in Clojure. no.olavfosse.malt's API is a
one-to-one port of upstream with some extra conveniences and
interactive visualizations. no.olavfosse.malt is designed to be used
in conjunction with [[https://book.clerk.vision][Clerk]].

* How to run it?

1. Install Clojure
2. Start the notebooks with =$ clj=
3. Save a notebook file (nbs/*) to render your changes
4. (not optional) Set up https://cider.mx for a goated dev env

* [[file:nbs/the_littlest_learner.clj][The Littlest Learner]]
This notebook is a summary of the book for the purpose of teaching and
testing no.olavfosse.malt.
