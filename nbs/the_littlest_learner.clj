;; ATTENTION: I've been thinking about this the wrong way; For now I
;;            just need to render a java.awt.image.BufferedImage JVM
;;            side and sent it OTW. Interactive viz is way down the
;;            line. https://book.clerk.vision/#images
;;
;; With JVM rendered graph and numerical nabla, I could get pretty far
;; if I put 2 hours into this project a day.
